# TripViewer

The goal of the project is to create a website allowing the user to have an overview of these different trips.

The user can enter the destinations he has already been to, those booked and those he plans to make.

For the different destinations, he can also indicate which means of transport he used to get to the place (also airline company: if flight by plane), the date of departure and arrival on the place, the price, and add a description of the trip and a list of good addresses (restaurants, hotels, etc...).

The user has the possibility to see these different trips on an interactive map (Google Maps API), he has the possibility to click on one of these destinations on the map to get information about his trip. he still has the possibility to create an account in order to save these different trips.
